You can use ```label_color``` if you want the state abbreviations in a different color than the default black.

```{r}
library("viridis")

df_mxstate$value = df_mxstate$afromexican / df_mxstate$pop 
# Will show a warning, look at the municipio examples to see how to remove it
mxhexbin_choropleth(df_mxstate, 
                    num_colors = 1,
                    label_color = "white",
                    title = "Percentage of the population that self-identifies as Afro-Mexican") +
  scale_fill_viridis()
